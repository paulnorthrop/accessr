Description: Provides functions to produce accessible html slides, html, Word 
    and PDF documents from input R markdown files. Currently, the option to 
    produce an accessible PDF file is only available on a Windows Operating 
    System. One aspect of accessibility is providing headings that are 
    recognised by a screen reader, providing a navigational tool for a blind or 
    partially-sighted person. A main aim is to enable documents of different 
    formats to be produced from a single R markdown source file using a single 
    function call.  The render() function from the rmarkdown package 
    <https://cran.r-project.org/package=rmarkdown> is used to render R markdown 
    files. A zip file containing multiple files can be produced from a single 
    function call.  A user-supplied template Word document can be used to 
    determine the formatting of the output Word document. When the output 
    format is a Word document the knitr chunk options out.width and/or 
    out.height can be used to set the dimensions of a figure (R-generated or 
    external image). Accessible PDF files are produced from Word documents 
    using OfficeToPDF <https://github.com/cognidox/OfficeToPDF>.  A convenience
    function, install_otp() is provided to install this software. The option to 
    print html output to (non-accessible) PDF files is also available.
