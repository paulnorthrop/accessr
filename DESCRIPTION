Description: Provides functions to produce accessible html, Word and PDF 
    documents from input R markdown files.  A main aim is to enable documents 
    of different formats to be produced from a single R markdown source file 
    using a single function call.  The render() function from the rmarkdown 
    package <https://cran.r-project.org/package=rmarkdown> is used to render
    R markdown files. A zip file containing multiple files can be 
    produced from a single function call.  When the output format is a Word 
    document the knitr chunk options out.width and/or out.height can be used to 
    set the dimensions of a figure (R-generated or external image).  This 
    functionality is not normally available. Accessible PDF files are produced 
    from Word documents using 
    OfficeToPDF <https://github.com/cognidox/OfficeToPDF>.  A convenience
    function, install_otp() is provided to install this software. The option to 
    print html output to (non-accessible) PDF files is also available.
