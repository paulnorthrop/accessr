\title{Converts R markdown code to ioslides html presentations}
\usage{
rmd2ioslides(x, zip = TRUE, add = FALSE, quiet = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A character vector containing the names (no extension) of the
\code{.Rmd} files to convert  if they are in the current working directory, or
paths to the files, either absolute or relative to the current working
directory, e.g., \code{DIRECTORY/file1}.  The \code{.html}
files are created in the same directory as their respective \code{.Rmd}
file.  If \code{x} is missing then an html file is created from each of
the \code{.Rmd} files in the current working directory.}

\item{zip}{A logical scalar or character vector indicating whether PDF
files should be put into a zip archive.  If \code{zip = FALSE} then no
zip archive is created.  Otherwise, an archive is created in each unique
directory involved in \code{x}.  If \code{zip = TRUE} then any archive
created has the name \code{accessr_ioslides.zip}.  If \code{zip} is a
character vector of zip file names (no extension) then these names are
used to name the zip archives.  The names are recycled to the length of
the number of unique directories, if necessary.}

\item{add}{A logical scalar that determines what happens if the output
zip file already exists.  If \code{add = TRUE} then files are added to the
zip file and if \code{add = FALSE} then the zip file is deleted and will
only contain newly-created files.}

\item{quiet}{Argument of the same name passed to
\code{\link[rmarkdown]{render}} to determine what is printed during
rendering from knitr.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to
\code{\link[rmarkdown]{ioslides_presentation}}.}
}
\value{
A character vector containing the paths of the output html files.
}
\description{
Creates accessible html ioslides presentations using R markdown's
\code{\link[rmarkdown]{ioslides_presentation}} argument to
\code{\link[rmarkdown]{render}}. Zip archives of the html files may be
created.
}
\details{
The simplest setup is to have the \code{.Rmd} files in the current
  working directory, but it is possible to have the \code{.Rmd} files in
  different directories.

  The \code{\link[rmarkdown]{render}} function, with the argument
  \code{output_file =} \code{\link[rmarkdown]{ioslides_presentation}}
  creates the ioslides html files.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# All files in the current working directory
rmd2ioslides(c("file1", "file2"))
